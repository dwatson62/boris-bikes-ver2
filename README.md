Boris Bike V2
=======================

## Synopsis

This was my second attempt at creating the Boris Bikes project from Makers Academy Week 1. (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/boris_bikes)

After having a little more experience with Ruby and Rspec, I managed to complete the project. This simulates the Boris Bikes scheme in London, where users can dock and rent bikes from docking stations, and where broken bikes can be sent to a garage to be fixed. This was a useful project in teaching the basics of OOD and TTD, and in using modules to help DRY out the code.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby
- Rspec
